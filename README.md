Submarine - A Unity3D Project
=========

###A simple 3D submarine exploration game created in Unity3D. It is the first non-tutorial game I've created in Unity. 

This game was originally created with C++ and OpenGL for a university class and ported into Unity3D for experimentation. The game essentially has no goal at this point. The game includes experimentation with:
- changing render settings at runtime (fog change for above/below water)
- simple flocking algorithms (for fish)
- simple animation (submarine propellers and light)
- particle effects (bubbles)
- sound effects (idle, acceleration, collisions)
- terrain creation

I hope to continue this project as I experiment and learn more in Unity! 
The game can be played [here](www.tannerhoffman.com/Sub_Beta.html), no guarantees that this will be the most recent version!
