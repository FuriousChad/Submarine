Submarine - A Unity3D Project
=========

###A simple 3D submarine exploration game created in Unity3D. It is the first non-tutorial game I've created in Unity. 

- The code can be found in Assets/Scripts
- The game can be played [here](www.tannerhoffman.com/Sub_Beta.html) or with the executables in the /Executables folder. The Mac version is self contained while the Windows version need the accompanying Submarine_Windows_Data folder.
